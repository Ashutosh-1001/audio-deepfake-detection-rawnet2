# audio-deepfake-detection-rawnet2


Part 1: Research & Model Selection

✅ 1. RawNet2
Key Technical Innovation: An end-to-end deep neural network that processes raw audio waveforms directly, eliminating the need for manual feature extraction.

Performance: Achieves an impressive ~0.29% Equal Error Rate (EER) on the ASVspoof 2019 LA dataset.

Why it’s promising: Offers a streamlined pipeline and potential for real-time inference, while delivering strong detection performance.

Challenges: Demands high GPU memory and is prone to overfitting, especially on limited datasets.

✅ 2. AASIST (Audio Anti-Spoofing using Integrated Spectro-Temporal modeling)
Key Technical Innovation: Integrates raw waveform and spectrogram features through a combination of attention mechanisms and graph-based modeling.

Performance: Achieves <1% EER on ASVspoof 2021, making it one of the top-performing models.

Why it’s promising: Demonstrates exceptional robustness to a wide range of spoofing attacks and generalizes well across datasets.

Challenges: The architecture is complex and computationally heavy, leading to slower inference times.

✅ 3. LFCC + GMM (Linear Frequency Cepstral Coefficients + Gaussian Mixture Model)
Key Technical Innovation: A classical approach using handcrafted features and statistical modeling, with no reliance on deep learning.

Performance: Around 10% EER on benchmark datasets.

Why it’s promising: Offers very fast inference, low computational overhead, and is easy to interpret and implement.

Challenges: Struggles significantly with generalization, especially when exposed to unseen spoofing techniques.


Part 3 Documentation & Analysis

🛠️ 1. Implementation Documentation
🧩 Challenges Encountered
One of the first challenges was dealing with the dataset structure — the ASVspoof2019 dataset is large, with separate folders for training, evaluation, and metadata. Locating the correct protocol file and matching it with the corresponding audio samples required careful attention to detail.

Another challenge was that the real RawNet2 model is complex and not lightweight. Due to time and resource constraints, it wasn't practical to train or run the full version in this take-home assessment.

🛠️ How These Were Addressed
To move forward efficiently, I decided to:

Use a small subset (5 files) for testing and demonstration.

Implement a simplified dummy version of RawNet2, which helped ensure the data preprocessing and inference pipeline was working correctly.

Make clear notes in the code to mark where the dummy model can be replaced with the real one.

🤔 Assumptions Made
The protocol file contains the correct mapping of audio samples to labels (bonafide vs spoof).

Using a dummy model was sufficient for this assignment to showcase the pipeline and structure of a detection system.

The small subset is representative enough to demonstrate basic functionality.

📊 2. Analysis
🧠 Why This Model Was Selected
RawNet2 is a well-established baseline for audio deepfake detection. It directly operates on raw audio waveforms, removing the need for explicit feature extraction (like MFCC or spectrograms). It’s commonly used in research and competitive benchmarks such as ASVspoof.

🧬 How the Model Works (High-Level)
RawNet2 processes raw audio in the following way:

Convolutional layers extract time-domain features from the waveform.

Residual blocks help preserve useful information across layers.

Pooling layers reduce dimensionality.

A fully connected layer finally outputs a prediction: real (bonafide) or fake (spoofed).


✅ Strengths Observed
The model accepts raw audio — no need for additional preprocessing.

End-to-end pipeline is easy to integrate into a real-time system.

Label mapping and predictions are working correctly

❌ Weaknesses Observed
Small dataset makes it hard to generalize.

No robustness tested under noisy or unseen conditions.

🚀 Suggestions for Future Improvement
Add data augmentation like background noise, speed perturbation.

Consider domain adaptation if deploying in real-world environments.


🪞 3. Reflection Questions
1. What were the most significant challenges in implementing this model?
The hardest part was setting up the dataset and ensuring the file paths aligned correctly with the protocol file. Also, the RawNet2 model is quite heavy and non-trivial to reimplement without pretrained weights, so I had to come up with a working dummy version to simulate the full pipeline.

2. How might this approach perform in real-world conditions vs. research datasets?
In real-world scenarios, models trained on clean datasets may struggle with noisy environments, varied microphones, or unexpected spoofing methods. The model needs additional robustness checks before deployment in production systems.

3. What additional data or resources would improve performance?
Larger, more diverse datasets with multiple spoofing techniques.

Noisy or real-world recordings for training robustness.

Pretrained models or access to GPU training resources.

4. How would you approach deploying this model in a production environment?
To deploy in production:

Convert the model to a lightweight format like TorchScript or ONNX.

Use a FastAPI backend with GPU acceleration if needed.

Implement a streaming frontend (e.g., WebRTC for voice input).

Monitor real-time predictions and periodically retrain with new spoof samples.
